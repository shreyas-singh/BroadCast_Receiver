// this is the class that will extend BroadcadtREceiver and will override the method onReceive. 
// whenever the broadcast receiver hears for an event , onReceive method is thriggered. 
// This is triggered on the same thread as Main Thread that is UI thread so t should not be used to do long running process. 
// Moreover if we create an asynchronous task from this class , then nce onReceive is completed then sysetem kills all the process and so asynchronus tak would be killed.
